const sprintPlanning = '{"headline": "Sprint Planning", "author":"Tim Deckel", "text":"The first Event that happens during a sprint is the Sprint Planning, it is a meeting that starts off the sprint and during this meeting the goal and all of the smaller tasks that the team collectively decides need to be done to complete the goal. During the Sprint planning meeting the Product Owner is the person that ensures that the attendees are prepared to talk about the most important issues and topics and makes sure that people that are not necessarily a part of the scrum team but are important for the meeting are invited if necessary. The main three topics that the meeting covers are; Why is this sprint valuable?  What can be done this sprint? and How will the chosen work get done? There is not much point to have a sprint if they don’t provide value to the project and determining what value would be created helps the team take ownership and feel motivated about the upcoming work. It also helps each member of the team to get a perspective of which things have a high priority enabling them to be empowered to make decisions as they are needed without having to check with a supervisor or such which in turn improves the effectiveness of the team. This discussion is also shared with the shareholder to convey what values and benefit it brings them for their project. Motivation is great for a team to have but clear goals and tasks are just as important and during this meeting the team with the help of the product owner talks through which items in the backlog to include in the sprint. This is a great time to refine and update the tasks that are to be included. To choose what things to include in the sprint based on the tasks complexity and how long the team members guess the tasks are going to take to complete is a difficult thing and is not something that can be completely predicted with complete accuracy but as the determining of these factors are a team effort, the teams own experience and knowledge of past performance is used to base these predictions on. After why and what is determined it is time to discuss the how! How is the work going to be completed? This part of the meeting is largely up to the developers that are going to partake in the sprint. Each item and tasks that are going to be included are discussed and a definition of done is agreed upon for each task. A common way this is done is by dividing up tasks into smaller ones that are feasible to be completed in one workday to try and encourage flexibility in the workload. The developers that are participating in the work are responsible for this division to ensure that each task is appropriate for the team. The items selected from the product backlog and the plan to carry them out is referred to as the sprint backlog and each sprint is usually not longer than one month and shorter sprint are also common."}';
const dailyScrum = '{"headline": "Daily Scrum", "author":"Tim Deckel", "text":"The daily scrum is a meeting for the team that everyone in the team attends, its purpose is to update the team about the progress each member made the previous day, and bring up thoughts and concerns regarding the project development and if the product owner or the scrum master is also developers they participate  It’s a great time for members to ask for help with tasks that are especially challenging or bring up issues that are blocking team members progress. These meetings are meant to last around 15 minutes and for simplicity at the same time and place each day and are traditionally made standing up so as to not drag on too long. Other than the factors of when, how long and who attend these meetings, how the meetings actually end up is up to the team and will look different for each team based on their preference to make sure the meeting best serves the team in making sure the meeting provides value to the team by making sure each member is aware of what is happening on other parts of the project, helps with quick decision making for issues that needs it, quickly identifies issues that might block progress and thus eliminates the need for additional meetings and wasteful communication. Although it is not the only event where developers meet and discuss issues and change plans, it is one of the more important ones for the efficiency of the team."}'
const sprintReview = '{"headline": "Sprint Review", "author":"Tim Deckel", "text":"The Sprint Review is the second to last Event in the Sprint cycle and its purpose is to examine the result of the sprint, what was achieved and in turn determine what the next goal is for the project. During this meeting the team presents what they have done to the shareholders and a discussion about the progress towards the completion of the project as a whole is common. The meeting attendees also discuss what changed in their environment during the sprint and based on these factors the next steps are determined and changes to the backlog is made to reflect the decisions that were made. The Sprint review meeting is a longer meeting, usually limited to 4 hours for a standard one month sprint and shorter if the sprint is shorter."}';
const sprintRetrospective = '{"headline": "Sprint Retrospective", "author":"Tim Deckel", "text": "The Purpose of the last event of the Sprint is to take a moment and look back at the lessons learned and challenges faced. It’s an inquisitive look into the past sprint and during the meeting the team members bring up things that went well such as good communication within the team, a well planned structure or maybe some issues with the tasks that weren’t foreseen. Each part and task is picked apart with an objective view and discussed to find things that went good, things that went not so good and possible improvements to the teams process is hopefully identified. In essence during this meeting every major task, challenge and lesson and even the lack of, is discussed within the team in an effort to extract as much valuable information with the purpose of preventing the issues that was preventable and improving already existing processes to make sure that each and every member of the development team can function as well as they possibly can for the purpose of creating more value and eliminating hardships in the future. Then as improvements and changes are identified the backlog is changed and adapted to reflect the possible changes in priority. with this meeting the sprint is concluded and for a standard one month sprint, the retrospective is generally around three hours long and after that the cycle repeats itself until the project is done."}';
